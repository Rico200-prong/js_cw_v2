# Questions - Codes to practice

1. Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(“Enter your age:”) to get the age as input.

- Enter your age: 30
  - You are 5 years older than me.

2. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways

- using if else
- ternary operator.

```js
let a = 4;
let b = 3;
// Response: 4 is greater
```

3. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?

- Enter a number: 2

  - 2 is an even number

- Enter a number: 9
  - 9 is is an odd number.

_Further Research: Research the input method "prompt()"._

_ND: Try your best to solve this without AI. For team presentation, i'll pick one of this questions for any of your team members to code live in class on saturday._
